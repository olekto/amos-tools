This is a small tool which is basically a rewritten extractContig, to instead extract 
a scaffold from an AMOS bank for analysis by amosvalidate and visual inspection in 
Hawkeye. Bacterial sized assemblies are often small enough that one can load the entire 
assembly into Hawkeye, but in my experience it's impossible with larger genomes 
(like vertebrates) to load everything into Hawkeye. 

This tool hopefully facilitates this, and makes it possible to inspect scaffolds from
vertebrate assemblies. 

License is not decided upon yet, but it builds on source that's under the Artistic 
License, but I will put it under GPLv3 if possible.
