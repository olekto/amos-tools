This is a small tool which is basically a rewritten extractContig, to instead extract 
a scaffold from an AMOS bank for analysis by amosvalidate and visual inspection in 
Hawkeye. Bacterial sized assemblies are often small enough that one can load the 
entire assembly into Hawkeye, but in my experience it's impossible with larger 
genomes (like vertebrates) to load everything into Hawkeye. 

This tool hopefully facilitates this, and makes it possible to inspect scaffolds from
vertebrate assemblies. 

Usage:
extractScaffold -b <AMOS bank> -l 
- lists all scaffolds, their IID, EID, number of contigs, number of bases and span. 
Use this to find the IID of the scaffold of interest.

extractScaffold -b <AMOS bank> -s <scaffold IID> -n <new AMOS bank>
- extracts the scaffold with IID together with all its reads, fragments,
libraries and contigs into a new AMOS bank. This new bank can then be inspected by
Hawkeye or validated by amosvalidate.

License is not decided upon yet, but it builds on source that's under the Artistic 
License, but I will put it under GPLv3 if possible.
