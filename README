These are a couple of small, hopefully useful, tools for the AMOS system.

extractScaffold is basically a rewritten extractContig, made to extract a scaffold 
instead of just a contig to a new AMOS bank. This new AMOS bank can then be used 
for analysis with amosvalidate, and visual inspection in Hawkeye.  
Bacterial sized assemblies are often small enough that one can load the 
entire assembly into Hawkeye, but in my experience it's impossible with larger 
genomes (like vertebrates) to load everything into Hawkeye, so the option of loading
just one scaffold should be useful. The scaffold view in Hawkeye might be a bit slow
however.

Usage:
extractScaffold -b <AMOS bank> -l 
- lists all scaffolds, their IID, EID, number of contigs, number of bases and span. 
Use this to find the IID of the scaffold of interest. This command for example, will 
sort the output by span size in the bank called e_coli_ca_mp_bogart.bnk:
extractScaffold -b e_coli_ca_mp_bogart.bnk -l | sort -k5,5 -n

extractScaffold -b <AMOS bank> -s <scaffold IID> -n <new AMOS bank>
- extracts the scaffold with IID together with all its reads, fragments,
libraries and contigs into a new AMOS bank. This new bank can then be inspected by
Hawkeye or validated by amosvalidate.
