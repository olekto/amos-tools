I've only included a makefile with these programs. You will have to edit the makefile 
yourself to set the proper path to AMOS' include and library directories (I could
probably have done it somewhat different and easier, but I do not know how at the moment.)

You have to have an AMOS installation somewhere to be able to use these programs.

You can use the programs where ever you want after compiling them.

As for licensing, they are under the original Artistic License for the moment, but this
might change later (to GPL or something).
